# BattleshipsStateTracker
BattleshipsStateTracker

## Implement a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that support the following logic:

1. Create a board

2. Add a battleship to the board

3. Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a hit or a miss

4. Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)
