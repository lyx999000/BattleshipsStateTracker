# BattleshipsStateTracker
BattleshipsStateTracker

Implement a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that must support the
following logic:
● Create a board
● Add a battleship to the board
● Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a
hit or a miss
● Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)
